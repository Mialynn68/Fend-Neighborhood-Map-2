# frontend-nanodegree-project neighborhood map  Version 1.0  20/08/2018

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Below you will find some information on how to run this app.<br>

## General information
----------------------
This app uses the foursquare API to fetch coffee places in the Hamburg HarbourCity area and displays them as list as well as map view with markers.
The list of locations is searchable. On click on one of the list entries the associated marker is animated and an infowindow is shown, containing further information like the locationÂ´s name and address if available. Additionally a (user provided) photo of the location is shown if available. Selecting a marker also displays the infowindow.


## Instructions
----------------
To launch the project in developer mode run 'npm install' and 'npm start'.

For the project to build run 'npm run build'.
To be able to use the App offline there is a ServiceWorker installed. Please note that you have to run 'npm run build' to make use of this functionality.
